# Tracking Firepower in Ukraine: Is Military Aid a Proxy for Weapons Deployment?

This project investigates whether international military aid to Ukraine can be used as a proxy for battlefield activity. Using satellite fire data and spatial models, we examine whether allocated military support correlates with fire activity in contested regions, suggesting active deployment of aid-delivered weapons.

We combine geolocated fire data from The Economistâ€™s War Fire Dataset and military aid allocations from the Ukraine Support Tracker (Trebesch et al., 2023). Control maps from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), road networks from the World Bank (2023), and mineral deposit data from the USGS are used to test four geospatial hypotheses.

## Main Findings

We find a statistically significant correlation between cumulative military aid and war-related fire activity. Correlations are stronger in Ukrainian-controlled areas and in zones with good road access, suggesting efficient redistribution of aid. Surprisingly, war activity also increases near strategic mineral sites, possibly due to the location of Russian forces rather than deliberate avoidance by Ukraine.

## Key Visualizations

Cumulative military aid and war fire activity grow together over time:
